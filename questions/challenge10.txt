(This challenge is worth 5 points)

Your task is to create a function that will take in an array of weather objects and will return a rounded average of the wind speed.

Since we work with an unknown amount of entries, you will need to calculate the average wind speed using loops.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleEntries = [
      { 
        temperature:0, 
        weather:"sunny", 
        windDirection: "NNE", 
        windSpeed:24
      },
      { 
        temperature:10, 
        weather:"cloudy", 
        windDirection: "NNE", 
        windSpeed:9 
      }
    ] 
    
Output:

    17
