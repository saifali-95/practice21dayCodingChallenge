Your task is to write a function that will take in a launch date and a mission name as strings. Calculate the difference between two dates in days and return an object containing the name of the mission and a rounded day difference.

A part of the code has been written for you, and it is important that it stays the same for the tests to work out.

Examples
Input:

    const launchDate = "2021-12-12"
    const fakeToday = "2021-12-01"
    const missionName = "Moon visit"
    
Output:

    {
      missionName = "Moon visit",
      daysRemaining = 11
    }
