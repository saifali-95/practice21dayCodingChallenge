Making sure that a value is within a specific range is a common task in programming. In this case, the structure given is a gauge object with a current value, a minimum and a maximum. If the current value is between the minimum and maximum, then everything is peachy, if not, we return a message saying that there is trouble.

Your task is to create a function that will take the gauge object as a parameter, and will return true if the current value is between the minimum and maximum, and return false if the value is outside those.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleGauge = {
      current:0.4,
      min:0.1,
      max:0.9
    }
    
Output:

    true
    
Input:

    const exampleGauge = {
      current:1.4,
      min:0.1,
      max:0.4
    }
    
Output:

    false
